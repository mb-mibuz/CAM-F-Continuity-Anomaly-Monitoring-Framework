I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Josiah Wang, for his invaluable guidance, patience and support throughout this project. His insights into both the technical challenges and broader research implications were instrumental in shaping CAM-F into a practical solution.

I am grateful to Dr Nuri Cingillioglu for serving as my second marker and providing constructive feedback at the start of project's development.

Special thanks go to my friend Rolando Charles who generously assisted with filming test scenarios, helping to create the synthetic film footage necessary for validating the system.

I would also like to thank Hahyun Lee for his invaluable contribution in consulting and assisting with copy editing, which significantly improved the clarity and quality of this report.

Finally, I extend my appreciation to the open-source community, whose tools and libraries formed the foundation upon which CAM-F was built.
